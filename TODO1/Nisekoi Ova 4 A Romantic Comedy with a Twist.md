Nisekoi Ova 4 is a must-watch for fans of the series who want to enjoy more of the hilarious and heartwarming antics of Raku and his harem. It is also a good introduction for newcomers who want to get a taste of the series' unique blend of comedy, romance, and drama.
  
Nisekoi Ova 4 has received mixed reviews from fans and critics alike. Some praised the episode for its humor, fanservice, and animation quality, while others criticized it for its lack of plot development, originality, and character depth. Here are some of the opinions from various sources:
 
- "I haven't laughed this hard since the penultimate episode of Nisekoi that involved the Romeo Juliet Play. It is adapted from Chapter 64 of the Manga. Characters: Remain consistent in their behaviour Animation: Bright and colourful as usual." - Anime-Planet[^3^]
- "Nisekoi has quite a few charming OST pieces, that the OVA refuse to use. The intro and outro of the second season is in here, and it`s as average as I remember. The intro and outro for the magical girl part, somehow, I liked. And combined with the animation, it was pleasant to watch." - MyAnimeList[^4^]
- "If you're wondering if the scriptwriting improved, you will be sorely disappointed. It uses the same old antics, but even then, the humor is far drier than its parent story. On top of that, the plot jumps all over the place (and since when did Nisekoi ever have a straight plotline? Good question.). As for the characters themselves, they don't change much from the second season, which is to be expected since this is just a single OVA." - MyAnimeList[^1^]
- "The Nisekoi OVA, I can say for sure, was a blast to watch and is enjoyable just like the show itself. But even as good as it was, it still has flaws. There are 3 episodes of the OVA, so let me talk about each one individually." - MyAnimeList[^2^]

In conclusion, Nisekoi Ova 4 is a fun and entertaining episode that offers more of the same elements that made the series popular. However, it is not without its flaws and may not appeal to everyone's tastes. It is recommended for fans who want to see more of their favorite characters and scenarios, but not for those who expect a serious or meaningful story.
