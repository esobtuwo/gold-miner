One of the most important updates for Rainbow Six Vegas 2 PC is the version 1.03 patch, which was released in July 2008. This patch adds new features, fixes bugs, and balances the gameplay. Here are some of the main changes that the patch brings:
 
- New ranks: The patch adds many additional ranks for you to unlock past the rank of Elite. XP youâve already accumulated as Elite will be applied towards the new ranks.
- New A.C.E.S.: The A.C.E.S. now go up to 100 for each of the three categories: Marksman, CQB and Assault. Each A.C.E.S. level earned contains a substantial XP reward. Points youâve already accumulated in each of the categories will be applied towards the new levels.
- Grenade indicator: When inside the damage radius of a Frag or Incendiary Grenade, a grenade indicator Icon is displayed on the screen.
- High Stakes: This is a new gameplay option that makes the game more realistic and challenging. It includes limited HUD, no radar, no grenade indicator, no health regeneration, no auto-aim, less ammunition, and more.
- Weapons and gadgets balancing: The patch adjusts the explosion delay of the incendiary grenade, the detonation speed of the C4, the damage of sniper rifles at long range, the base accuracy of light machine guns, the rate of fire for some of the assault rifles, shotguns and an SMG, and the time it takes to zoom in and out with weapons.
- Respawns in Team Deathmatch: Hosts can choose whether or not their match uses random respawns in Team Deathmatch.
- Voice chat: Hosts can choose to enable voice chat between living and dead players of the same team so that when you die you can keep talking with your teammates.
- Ping issues: The patch fixes some ping issues that affected the online gameplay.
- Terrorist hunt spawning: The patch fixes the terrorist hunt spawning system that sometimes caused enemies to spawn behind players or in unreachable areas.
- Automatic weapons shoot without holding the trigger: The patch fixes a bug that caused some automatic weapons to shoot without holding the trigger.
- Spawn with leader in Streets map: The patch fixes a bug that caused players to spawn with their leader in Streets map instead of at their own spawn point.
- Custom search issues: The patch fixes some custom search issues that prevented players from finding matches with their preferred settings.
